.TH "REC_CONTROL" "1" "Mar 30, 2022" "" "PowerDNS Recursor"
.SH NAME
rec_control \- Command line tool to control a running Recursor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBrec_control\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fICOMMAND\fP [\fICOMMAND\-OPTION\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBrec_control\fP allows the operator to query and control a running
instance of the PowerDNS Recursor.
.sp
\fBrec_control\fP talks to the recursor via a the \(aqcontrolsocket\(aq. Which
is usually located in \fB/var/run\fP . The \fI\-\-socket\-dir\fP or the \fI\-\-config\-dir\fP
and \fI\-\-config\-name\fP switches control to which process \fBrec_control\fP
connects.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To see if the Recursor is alive, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# rec_control ping
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To stop the recursor by hand, run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# rec_control quit
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To dump the cache to disk, execute:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# rec_control dump\-cache /tmp/the\-cache
.ft P
.fi

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Before version 4.5.0, for each command that writes to a file, \fBpdns_recursor\fP would open the file to write to.
Starting with 4.5.0, the files are opened by the \fBrec_control\fP command itself using the credentials and the current working directory of the user running \fBrec_control\fP\&.
A single minus \fI\-\fP can be used as a filename to write the data to the standard output stream.

root trust anchor is not possible.
.TP
.B dump\-cache \fIFILENAME\fP
Dumps the entire cache to \fIFILENAME\fP\&. This file should not exist already,
PowerDNS will refuse to overwrite it. While dumping, the recursor
might not answer questions.
.sp
Typical PowerDNS Recursors run multiple threads, therefore you\(aqll see
duplicate, different entries for the same domains. The negative cache is
also dumped to the same file. The per\-thread positive and negative cache
dumps are separated with an appropriate comment.
.TP
.B dump\-edns \fIFILENAME\fP
Dumps the EDNS status to the filename mentioned. This file should not exist
already, PowerDNS will refuse to overwrite it. While dumping, the recursor
will not answer questions.
.TP
.B dump\-failedservers \fIFILENAME\fP
Dump the contents of the failed server map to the \fIFILENAME\fP mentioned.
This file should not exist already, PowerDNS will refuse to
overwrite it otherwise. While dumping, the recursor will not answer
questions.
.TP
.B dump\-non\-resolving \fIFILENAME\fP
Dump the contents of the map of nameserver names that did not resolve to
an address.  This file should not exist already, PowerDNS will
refuse to overwrite it otherwise. While dumping, the recursor will
not answer questions.
.TP
.B dump\-nsspeeds \fIFILENAME\fP
Dumps the nameserver speed statistics to the \fIFILENAME\fP mentioned. This
file should not exist already, PowerDNS will refuse to overwrite it. While
dumping, the recursor will not answer questions. Statistics are kept per
thread, and the dumps end up in the same file.
.TP
.B dump\-rpz \fIZONE NAME\fP \fIFILE NAME\fP
Dumps the content of the RPZ zone named \fIZONE NAME\fP to the \fIFILENAME\fP
mentioned. This file should not exist already, PowerDNS will refuse to
overwrite it otherwise. While dumping, the recursor will not answer
questions.

.B dump\-throttlemap \fIFILENAME\fP
Dump the contents of the throttle map to the \fIFILENAME\fP mentioned.
This file should not exist already, PowerDNS will refuse to
overwrite it otherwise. While dumping, the recursor will not answer
questions.

Asks for a password then returns the hashed and salted version,
to use as a webserver password or API key. This command does
not contact the recursor but does the hashing inside rec_control.
An optional scrypt work factor can be specified, in power of two.
The default is 1024.
.TP
.B help
Shows a list of supported commands understood by the running
\fBpdns_recursor\fP
.TP
.B ping
Check if server is alive.
.TP
.B quit
Request shutdown of the recursor, exiting the process while
letting the OS clean up resources.
.TP
.B quit\-nicely
Request nice shutdown of the recursor. This method allows all

case of errors.
.TP
.B set\-carbon\-server \fICARBON SERVER\fP [\fICARBON OURNAME\fP]

.TP
.B trace\-regex \fIREGEX\fP
Emit resolution trace for matching queries. Empty regex to disable trace.
.sp
Queries matching this regular expression will generate voluminous tracing
output. Be aware that matches from the packet cache will still not generate
tracing. To unset the regex, pass \fBtrace\-regex\fP without a new regex.
.sp
The regular expression is matched against domain queries terminated with a
dot. For example the regex \fB\(aqpowerdns.com$\(aq\fP will not match a query for
\fB\(aqwww.powerdns.com\(aq\fP, since the attempted match will be with
\fB\(aqwww.powerdns.com.\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
In addition, since this is a regular expression, to exclusively match
queries for \fB\(aqwww.powerdns.com\(aq\fP, one should escape the dots:
\fB\(aq^www\e.powerdns\e.com\e.$\(aq\fP\&.
Note that the single quotes prevent
further interpretation of the backslashes by the shell.
.sp
Multiple matches can be chained with the \fB|\fP operator. For example, to
match all queries for Dutch (\fB\&.nl\fP) and German (\fB\&.de\fP) domain names, use:
\fB\(aq\e.nl\e.$|\e.de\e.$\(aq\fP\&.
.TP
.B unload\-lua\-script
Unloads Lua script if one was loaded.
.TP
.B version
Report running version.
.TP
.B wipe\-cache \fIDOMAIN\fP [\fIDOMAIN\fP] [...]
Wipe entries for \fIDOMAIN\fP (exact name match) from the cache. This is useful
if, for example, an important server has a new IP address, but the TTL has
not yet expired. Multiple domain names can be passed.
\fIDOMAIN\fP can be suffixed with a \(aq$\(aq. to delete the whole tree from the
cache. i.e. \(aqpowerdns.com$\(aq will remove all cached entries under and
including the powerdns.com name.
.sp
\fBNote\fP: this command also wipes the negative cache.
.sp
\fBWarning\fP: Don\(aqt just wipe "www.somedomain.com", its NS records or CNAME
target may still be undesired, so wipe "somedomain.com" as well.
.TP
.B wipe\-cache\-typed \fIqtype\fP \fIDOMAIN\fP [\fIDOMAIN\fP] [...]
Same as wipe\-cache, but only wipe records of type \fIqtype\fP\&.
